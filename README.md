# CS229 Final Project
Jeff Jiang

This is a single-person project for CS229, and the project report is included in pdf file in this folder (report_jeff.pdf). The code for the two empirical approaches are included in this submission, named approach 1 and approach 2 respectively. I also include an initial attempt of fine-tuning LLaMA directly, which was abandoned due to not having enough compute power (requires GPU memory of >50 G) but can be theoretically run with the relavent resources. Please refer to the headings of the respective files for specific information.

The code in this folder can be easily generalized beyond the game of TicTacToe, by replacing files in the folder tictactoe/. with respective implmentations of other games, which we'll pursue as future directions in a continuation of this project beyond CS229.
